# Valum Client

Client for Val's UI Manager (Valum).

Valum is a simple small-scale server utility which interacts with the Valum Server and contains a webview for accessing Web UI's.

This project is mostly for personal use-cases such as turning on a LLM server remotely, but perhaps some self-hosting enthusiasts may find it useful.

#### What the Valum Server Does:

-   Send a wake-on-LAN request to a device
-   Ping the device
-   Sends a shutdown command to the device via SSH

#### What the Valum Client Does:

-   Connect and control your Valum Servers
-   Has a WebView to easily access and bookmark any WebUI's.
-   Technically you could link the webview to anything or just open links in a browser, its mostly just for organizational purposes.

And that's pretty much it!
